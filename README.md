# CS2013-CS3013 Software Engineering Project 
## Overview
This repository contains work completed for the Software Engineering project in Trinity College Dublin. The work was completed by a team of 6: 3 Third year students and 3 second year students in the School of Computer science and statistics. 
The project focused on developing extra features for oogo, a childcare marketplace platform. This repository is one of 2 utilised by the team during the course of this project. This repository was forked from the oogo repository which is itself forked from the sharetribe flex repository, as oogo is based on sharetribe flexes software for marketplace platforms. 

Our project focused on additional features not included in sharetribe flex's framework, essentially further customising sharetribe for oogo. This repository includes the 'favourite feature'. This feature allowed users to 'favourite' minders by clicking a button on the minders profile page. The users 'favourites' were saved to the users profile and they can access them to search by their favourites.
